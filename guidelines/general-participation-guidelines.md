## Intro

Individual participants at an event in the style of Web3 Partners should look to accomplish one or multiple personal goals over time by participating in these events

Having access to a skilled, engaged, and motivated group of professionals or similarly motivated community members can be difficult or potentially costly. However, by leveraging each other's mutual interests and goals, we can expect to create networks of contributions and participation that are equitable to all with a low cost and effort overhead

One thing that is of key importance to consider is that all participants are able to  give and take from each other. The benefit of this is to drive towards success and recover from failure

## What to do?

### Setting a goal

Maybe you are financially motivated, maybe you are motivated by the pursuit of knowledge, or maybe both or something else

Typical goals may fit into one of the following categories:

**Technical Developer**

Build products, experiment with new technologies, or advise on technical decisions, or contribute to an open project

**Business Developer**

Ideate to produce useful or innovative products or services, manage teams and finances, or create relationships between new or existing members of an ecosystem

**Community Ambassador**

Facilitate networking between community groups, host and plan events, or form & represent community ideals

**Content Creator**

Self-start and promote yourself, communicate to your audience about the state of the ecosystem, or facilitate open discussions

**Regular Community Member**

Let people create for you, interact with products and services, potentially even as a beta tester, or leave positive or negative feedback

**Something Else**

There are plenty of good roles that may suit you, some of which have yet to be created or formalized

### Following through 

Whatever is your goal, know that it is feasible. It is important to take small steps towards that goal

Part of the benefit of collaborating with open organizations or projects is that smaller incremental steps in the development process are able to be made into tasks or milestones. This allows for goals to be achieved in reasonable periods of time, even by individuals who still need to build up the necessary skills to follow through with an entire project of a larger scale

Reach out to any organization that you encounter during a meetup to find ways that you can help them, and request that in return they give you honest feedback and vouch for your work if it meets a professional quality
