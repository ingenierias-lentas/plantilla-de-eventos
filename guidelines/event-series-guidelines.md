## Intro

Event series are the main mode of connection and participation for Web3 Partners communities. They help to connect localized business communities and promote patterns for individual growth and goal achievement

Event series organizers should maintain a fluidity to the series organization and participation pattern. Members should be able to come and go, while the series of events maintains on the path towards the common goal of the community

One thing that is of key importance to consider is that all participants are able to give and take from each other. The benefit of this is to drive towards success and recover from failure

## Format

Typically, an event series is comprised of the following components:
- Organizers - Community members with ambassador roles, responsible for setting up spaces and coordinating with speakers
- Speakers - Community members with some information that is both important to share and tht benefits from community participation
- Participants - Anyone else who can benefit from being a part of the group

Organizers should be prepared with the following resources to be made available to the community:
- Web page - Typically on web3partners.community or a subdomain
- Social media - Typically using the shared twitter (@web3partners_) or instagram (@web3partners)
- Event page - Typically on [Eventbrite](https://eventbrite.com) or similar using the shared Eventbrite organization
- Speaker onboarding form - Typically using the shared [speaker onboarding form](https://forms.gle/kGZ2ChToMXYwQean6). Template available [below](#further-resources)
- Small funding for events - Typically from a sponsor, the larger Web3 Partners community, or self-funded from some combination of local community members

## Execution

The execution of an event series should consider long-term planning and individual event planning

### Long-term planning

The key tenants of a Web3 Partners community may be derived from or inspired by the key tenants established by the [Ingenierias Lentas group](https://github.com/ingenierias-lentas/community). In short, find mutual benefit from those that you directly interact with, so that we can create more sustainable revenue pipelines and develop more pragmatic pathways for individual community members to achieve their goals

A long-term planning group may coincide with the organizers for individual events. This group should be consistently considering and generating community feedback as well as reaching out to new participants for co-organizer, speaker, or general participant roles

It may be best to hold weekly or bi-weekly meetings to review community feedback, coordinate amongst speakers, and perform other activities related to the organization of an individual event

It is important to keep in mind that organizers should also be benefitting from the process of organization, whether that be as a resume-booster, as a means to gain experience, or something else

### Individual event planning
