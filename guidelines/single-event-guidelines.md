## Intro

An event in the style of Web3 Partners should be considered as one in a continuous series. There are larger goals that are defined by the local and global community. This document mainly describes the flow of a single event. Please see the [event series guidelines](./event-series-guidelines.md) for information about the overarching goals for a local event series

Organizers should ensure that everything is as smooth as possible for participants, and also that they themselves are enjoying and growing from the process

One thing that is of key importance to consider is that all participants are able to give and take from each other. The benefit of this is to drive towards success and recover from failure

## Format

Typically, an event involves a collection of the following elements. Arrival / setup and cleanup / departure are necessary, but everything else may be arranged according to the discretion of the organizers:

- Arrival / setup
- Panel discussion
  - Question / Answer
- Single speaker presentation
  - Demo
  - Focus group
  - Ideation
- Cleanup / departure

## Execution

The execution of a single event should consider the pre-event planning, the day-of operations, and the feedback after the event

### Budget

So far, we have seen a necessary budget of around $200-300 per event, which may be subsidized by an interested partner organization in exchange for promoting their speakers, products, or community members

| Item | Cost | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| Physical space | $200-300 | 3-4 hours of space rental. May be higher or lower based on partnership agreements with space |
| Food & beverages | $100-200 | Small provisions for participants. Up to the discretion of the participants or organizers |

### Planning

The planning should be split into the following domains. This is a rough order that each step should be pursued, but some may be planned in parallel

1) Find a location - Consider target number of participants and necessary audio/visual components
2) Establish the topic of the event - Determine what is the overall theme for this session. This should be led by community preferences and finalized by the event organizers
3) Establish the event page - Ensure that people can be directed to the event. In some cases, the event page can be made before the final agenda is established
4) Find the event speakers - Reach out to speakers that have pertinent interests and milestones that may be good fit a speaker role for this event
5) Communicate and market the event - Get the word out. If you invite 80 people, expect 20 to show up
6) Finalize the event agenda - Be sure that people are aware of roughly what will happen prior to the event so that they can prepare

### Day-of

On the day of the event, there are a number of considerations to be aware of

1) Show up early
2) Greet and sign in participants as appropriate
3) Usher participants into the speaker sessions
4) Clean up at the end

### Feedback

As this is an event in a continuous series, feedback is one of the most important considerations of running an event. Organizers should use the feedback forms below or similar as the basis for improving on event organization. These template feedback forms may be made available as google forms on a web3partners.community website and distributed to speakers, other organizers, or even event participants as appropriate
