## Intro

Speakers at an event in the style of Web3 Partners should consider their time as valuable for reaching their personal or organizational goals

Having access to a group of engaged, motivated, and capable minds is rare and would otherwise be potentially costly. However, by leveraging each other's mutual interests and goals, we can expect to create networks of contributions and participation that are equitable to all with a low cost and effort overhead

One thing that is of key importance to consider is that all participants are able to  give and take from each other. The benefit of this is to drive towards success and recover from failure

## Presentation Style

Presentations should be kept succinct and focused, but they should also leave room for discussion and feedback where appropriate

A typical presentation is 30 minutes, although this may be changed at the discretion of the event organizers

Event organizers will be available to assist with moderation of discussion by default or may be requested to fill some other reasonable support role

### Topic

Typically, a speaker should define a few key points that they want to discuss and should facilitate the first part of the presentation around those points

Be sure to have all key points and support materials prepared prior to the start of the presentation. This means ensuring that demos work properly, graphics are easily understandable, and that audio/visual considerations are handled

### Wants

The second aspect of the presentation should be what the speaker wants to gain from presenting to the community. For example, a speaker may want feedback on the graphical design of a product, they may want to find collaborators for development, or they may want to know more about the motivations of a person who is in their target audience

Be creative but concise with what you are asking from the community. Remember that this process should be mutually beneficial

Speakers may decide to incorporate their requests into the presentation topics, such that they discuss one topic, then make one request, then repeat for the next topics and requests. They may alternatively decide to present all topics at once then make all requests at the end. It depends on the style of the presentation. Event organizers and community collaborators may have inputs on which style is best for your presentation

It may be a good idea to include QR codes, live URLs, or other leading links to encourage participation
